# Tech Talks for Eastern Europe

We're pleased to announce the launch of our series of tech talks for Eastern Europe, where we'll be exploring technical topics and features that our audience is most interested in.

As a Solution Architect at Elastic for the past three years, I've learned that Eastern Europe teams are looking for technical how-to's and feature-wise explanations. That's why we've created this series of tech deep dive presentations and demos to provide you with the information you need.

### How do you make machine learning work for you and not the other way around?
Machine Learning has long been an integral part of the Elastic Stack and is easily integrated into security and observability solutions. In this session, we'll show you the scope of problems ML can solve, how you can apply machine learning to solve your own problems on your data, what resources are required to do so, and why. We will also demonstrate how easy it is to create ML processes by yourself (metric split by ip, rare processes) and why we provide out-of-the-box processes.
