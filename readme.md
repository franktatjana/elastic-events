# Event Collection

This repository contains a collection of events I have attended, including online conferences, meetups, workshops, webinars, and their associated materials such as slide decks, useful links, PDF resources, and video links.

The goal of this repository is to centralize all the deliverables from these events so that they can be easily accessed and used for later reference. 

## Events

Here is a list of the events included in this repository:

1. [(Architecture) ELASTIC A LA CARTE: How to store data in Elasticsearch and not break the bank?](.ExampleConference2021)

Each event has its own folder in this repository, containing the relevant materials such as slide decks, PDF resources, and links to video recordings where available.
